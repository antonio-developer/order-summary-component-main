## My process

I started with the mobile, structuring the html with the classes, then I created the styles by elements from top to bottom, starting with the body, main, container card, etc.. Then I styled the hover elements. Finally I did the desktop styling.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I remembered many things about html and css like flexbox, BEM methodology, media queries, variables, mobile first.


### Continued development

I need to learn more about scss and semantic html.
